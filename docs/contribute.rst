How to contribute to spruned
----------------------------

If you went trough the reading till here... thanks :-)

Right now, even just using spruned is a way to contribute, if you take a minute to report bugs or
inconsistencies with bitcoind, so if you're going to set up a new spruned instance: thank you.

If you are a developer, feel free to open a PR. Not sure? Contact me before (mn3monic @ freenode).


And, obviously spruned needs:

- a better documentation :-)
- use cases
- proposals
- fixes
- extensive review of the code and the english (yes, I'm not ashamed and gladly accept english corrections, that is not
  my first language).
